<p>The first thing we do is completely disassemble the car. Every nut, bolt, piece of glass, wires, piece of trim is removed, cataloged and marked. Along the way we take notes for broken bolts, missing parts etc. From here we start a list of what we will need to complete your job in detail. Once the car is back from the media blaster - We will assess body damage and metalwork required - and which panels will be replaced or repaired.</p>
