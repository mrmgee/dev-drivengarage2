<p>Bodywork / Filler: Once everything is fit and we’re happy with the panel gaps and mods in metal we do our body filler work - We don’t call it “Bondo” and it’s not a bad word. Filler work is required to get the surface of all body panels closer to where we need them to be. Done properly, this filler can last 50+ years without issues.  Can we metalwork your car without using any filler? Totally - but that’s easily 800-1000 hours of labor to get there. Using modern body fillers - and making sure that our metalwork is within 1/16” or less we can get the same or better results in less time.</p>
