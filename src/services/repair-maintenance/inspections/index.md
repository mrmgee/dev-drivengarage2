    text: Let our certified techs perform a rigorous 40-point inspection to really dig into your car’s issues. Typically an inspection is the first step to diagnose problems, identify repairs, and make your vehicle safe. Even if you’ve had other shops look at your vehicle, it’s best for us to confirm the findings – and make sure nothing was missed.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
