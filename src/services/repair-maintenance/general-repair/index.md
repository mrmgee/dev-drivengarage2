    text: Don’t trust handing your keys to a shop littered with Prius(s) (or is it Priii?) - bring it to the folks that know classics, muscle cars and old schools. It’s a rare occasion you’ll find a Honda in our shop (though some of our customer love us so much they force us to work on their daily drivers as well).

    text: We use oil specially formulated for your old school engine. Did you know the EPA mandated the removal of zinc additives from most motor oils? This means that the stuff the Quickee lube sells is bad for your classic car - it needs that Zinc to keep the cam and lifters alive. We use only high quality zinc enhanced oils for most classic cars.
