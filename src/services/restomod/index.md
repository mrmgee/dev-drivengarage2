introHead: All the show + All the GO!
intro: <p>Whether we’re creating a wild Resto-Mod or something more subtle we follow a strict process to ensure quality of work and get the best outcome. Some of the steps change based on the type of build - but our process for the basic metalwork, body and paint remains the same no matter what level we are taking the job to.</p><p>Over the years we have honed our process to the 13 Step approach described here. There are smaller steps in-between - and we sweat every detail. We won’t compromise here, as compromising by skipping steps or changing our process usually results in sub-par work.</p>

    text: "For a full custom build this may be the most important part of the process as it gives the project a vision to move forward. We’ll not only spec the nuts and bolts components like engine and transmission, suspension, cooling and fuel systems - but also define the stance, body modifications, color and interior designs. We work with each client to realize their vision and our professional design team will offer a set of drawings that brings tasteful mods that will stand the test of time.</p>
    <p>
    Just like that guy on TV we provide a set of drawings done by hand that work through the design vision and choices that influence the entire build. We start with a line drawing from several views of the stock vehicle - then through a series of loose sketches we refine the stance, wheel choice and modification ideas. Ultimately after several design reviews with you we refine the design to a set of finished renderings that show what the whole package will look like in the end. It’s a fun process!"

    text: If running too lean, the off-idle circuit needs to be enriched. Regardless of the carburetor brand,  we can make the right adjustments to ensure your engine gets the correct amount of fuel it needs. If the problem is throttle response, the pump circuit needs to be more active. We’ll adjust your carburetor, or recommend a high-performance replacement, that will give you power when you need it. Lastly, the ignition spark timing curve and the air-fuel mix curve should be retuned. With the proper mix and firing, we’ll make sure your classic gives you the power to make it fun to drive again.

    text: <p>That’s a very loaded question! On the lower end our paint service requires at a minimum exterior disassembly with all trim and glass removed and stripping to bare metal. On the higher end and rotisserie restoration to concours level or a magazine feature worthy custom Resto-Mod and anything in-between is in our wheelhouse.  Price really comes down to level of fit and finish, modifications and parts we use.</p><p>There is no single price - but see the table below that details the basics for 3 levels of build level based on labor and components / modifications. There is crossover from one extreme to the other and every job is different - but you can use this as a guide to see how low - or far we can go.</p>
