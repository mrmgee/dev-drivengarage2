    text: Classic car owners know today’s gasoline is significantly different from the fuel mixture available when the car was new. The different formula effects performance, especially compared to using a carburetor instead of modern computer-controlled fuel-injected systems. Today’s gasolines can cause your carburetor to shift about 3-5% leaner and also cause misfires and poor throttle response. To get the most out of your classic car’s engine, you need to retune the carburetor and distributor.

    text: If running too lean, the off-idle circuit needs to be enriched. Regardless of the carburetor brand,  we can make the right adjustments to ensure your engine gets the correct amount of fuel it needs. If the problem is throttle response, the pump circuit needs to be more active. We’ll adjust your carburetor, or recommend a high-performance replacement, that will give you power when you need it. Lastly, the ignition spark timing curve and the air-fuel mix curve should be retuned. With the proper mix and firing, we’ll make sure your classic gives you the power to make it fun to drive again.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
