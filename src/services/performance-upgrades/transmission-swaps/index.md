    text: With a few components we can add timing control to most EFI systems. This enables the EFI computer to control the timing curve on your engine as well as the fuel map. This allows us to dial in your advance curve to make your car more responsive and put the fuel and timing map in concert to help make the most power at the right time.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.

      - que: Will my car pass smog if I switch to EFI?
        ans: In most cases, yes - but with exceptions. We’ve done conversions on smog era vehicles with California legal components in the past - but we need to spec the right components for you. We can’t do this for every vehicle - but kits are available for a surprisingly wide range from various companies.
