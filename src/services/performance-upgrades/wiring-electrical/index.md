    text: We will troubleshoot and diagnose any electrical issue. A complete rewire is usually the best solution. However we can also repair your system with materials that are as good, or better, than factory original to get you safely back on the road.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
