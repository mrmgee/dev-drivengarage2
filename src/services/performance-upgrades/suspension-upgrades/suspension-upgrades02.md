- **Better handling:** A well-upgraded suspension can make your car more responsive to steering input and reduce body roll in corners. This can make your car more fun to drive and safer on the road.
- **Smoother ride:** A good suspension upgrade can also improve the ride quality of your car by absorbing bumps and road imperfections more effectively. This can make your car more comfortable to drive, especially on long trips.
- **More ground clearance:** If you plan on taking your classic car off-road, an upgraded suspension can give you more ground clearance, which can help you avoid obstacles and improve your car's performance in rough terrain.
- **Customization:** There are many different suspension upgrades available, so you can customize your car's handling and ride quality to your specific preferences.
