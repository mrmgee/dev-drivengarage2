    text: Give your tired arms a break and upgrade to an electric power-assisted steering system (EPAS). The power-assist integrates into your classic car’s steering system to reduce the effort to turn the wheel. It makes turning a breeze without ruining your ride’s look with ugly components.

    position: 
    text: An electronic control box measures the amount of effort on the steering wheel and amplifies it with the aid of the electric motor. A potentiometer gives you control over the amount of assistance provided, allowing you to fine tune your EPAS experience. For example, you can have maximum power assist while on a parking lot, and less on the highway. The system is only active while turning.

We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
