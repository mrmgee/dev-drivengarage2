featLayoutTitle: Get it Straight and Sharp
featLayoutBody: <p>Laser straight panels and tight gaps don't happen by accident. We painstakenly dive into the process of straightening the panels. Although they may look straight, metal panels, whether they are original, or aftermarket are pretty wavy.</p><p>After you apply a new coat of shiny paint, the waves will really stand out! It's for this reason that we put a great deal of time and effort into the body of your car.</p>
