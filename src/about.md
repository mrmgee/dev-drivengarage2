Driven Garage was born out of a passion for classic cars – and keeping them on the road. We noticed many local repair shops closing, and the ones that service older cars more reluctant to work on them. We speak the language of classic cars / muscle cars – the old school knowledge like setting timing and adjusting a carburetor – but yet are well versed in electronic fuel injection technologies and computer controlled systems.

Most of all – we feel that there has been a loss of respect in the auto repair industry. Our mission is to respect the customer, respect the machine, and do good work at a fair price. We won’t sell you services you don’t need. We won’t apply inflated markups to parts. We won’t milk the clock on your dime… We want customers for life – and we want them to tell everyone about us. All we ask in return for our respect – is that you do the same… respect our expertise, our time, our overhead costs.
